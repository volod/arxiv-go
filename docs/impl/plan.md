# arxiv-go Implementation Plan

Forward-only: this file contains only work that remains. Product behavior, boundaries and
evaluation belong in [the specification](../openspec/spec.md). Task shape, statuses, ordering and
lifecycle rules belong in the [planning workflow](../guide/planning-workflow.md). Available behavior
and accepted results belong in [current-state documentation](current.md).

Stages: tasks for `crash-safety` through `video-restore` complete
[stage 1](../openspec/stage-1-core/README.md); `media-previews` delivers
[stage 2](../openspec/stage-2-previews/README.md); `cloud-publishing` delivers
[stage 3](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/README.md). A stage starts only after the previous stage's
checkpoint and proof are accepted.

All tasks: tests are deterministic, network-free and build fixtures in `t.TempDir()`; media
fixtures are generated, never committed; each new dependency is the one approved in the
[dependency table](../openspec/spec.md#dependencies) and enters `go.mod`/`go.sum` in the same
change; `make ci` must pass.

Test gates: every acceptance gate, declared run and CI job below runs on Linux (amd64) only.
Implementation still covers the Windows specifics in the specification; for Windows the gate is
`make build-all` and `make vet-windows` (both in `make ci`). Windows-only tests may be added and
skip on Linux, but they are not acceptance evidence. Runtime checks on a Windows host belong to the
deferred [Windows verification scenario](../guide/windows-verification.md), which is outside this
plan: no task waits for it, and Windows-only audit notes are routed there.

## Agent Implementation Tasks

### Cloud publishing -- `cloud-publishing`

#### research-cloud-target-apis

Confirm or amend the cloud target design against current Google Drive and Microsoft Graph APIs.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Cloud targets](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md)
- Agent status: CLEAR
- Research: yes
- Dependencies: [Stage-2 review](records/0033-preview-review-stage-2-previews.md).
- User-visible outcome: The stage-3 specification reflects verified upload, resume, hash, auth and
  quota behavior, and dependency choices keep a static single binary.
- Scope boundary: Documentation research, small throwaway probes outside the repository, spec
  amendment and task refinement. No production code.
- Data and artifact paths: `docs/openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md`, `docs/impl/plan.md`.
- Execution path: Read current API references; compare REST-only versus SDK binary size with a
  scratch build; record findings in the task record.
- Acceptance gates: Every design assertion in the cloud spec is confirmed with a source link or
  amended; dependency decision recorded; a supported negative result (for example SDK required) is
  valid.
- Documentation target: `docs/openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md`
- Review checkpoint: `review-stage-3-cloud`.

#### implement-cloud-target-interface

Add the target interface, publish WAL steps, link rewrite and the `publish` operation.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Target interface](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md#target-interface)
- Agent status: CLEAR
- Dependencies: `research-cloud-target-apis`.
- User-visible outcome: `arxgo publish` and `split --publish` drive any target resumably and rewrite
  description and registry links.
- Scope boundary: `internal/cloud` interface, in-memory fake target, session store in run state,
  publish recovery, link rewrite, secret redaction handler, CLI enablement. No real provider.
- Data and artifact paths: `internal/cloud/`, `internal/archive/publish.go`, `internal/cli/`.
- Execution path: Fake target with injectable failures between chunks.
- Acceptance gates: Resume after chunk failure, expired session restart, idempotent re-publish,
  links rewritten atomically, secrets absent from all outputs.
- Documentation target: `docs/impl/current/cloud-publishing.md`
- Review checkpoint: `review-stage-3-cloud`.

#### implement-google-drive-target

Publish the video archive to Google Drive.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Google Drive](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md#google-drive)
- Agent status: CLEAR
- Dependencies: `implement-cloud-target-interface`.
- User-visible outcome: `--publish gdrive` mirrors folders, uploads resumably and records
  `webViewLink`s.
- Scope boundary: REST client, auth flows, folder cache, resumable upload, MD5 idempotency,
  backoff, sharing option. Tested against recorded fixtures only.
- Data and artifact paths: `internal/cloud/gdrive/`, `test/testdata/cloud/gdrive/`.
- Execution path: `httptest.Server` replaying sanitized exchanges.
- Acceptance gates: Fixture scenarios from the cloud spec pass; no network in tests.
- Documentation target: `docs/impl/current/cloud-publishing.md`
- Review checkpoint: `review-stage-3-cloud`.

#### implement-sharepoint-target

Publish the video archive to a SharePoint document library.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Microsoft SharePoint](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md#microsoft-sharepoint)
- Agent status: CLEAR
- Dependencies: `implement-cloud-target-interface`.
- User-visible outcome: `--publish sharepoint` mirrors folders, uploads through upload sessions and
  records `webUrl`s.
- Scope boundary: Graph REST client, client-credential and device-code auth, folder creation,
  upload sessions, quickXorHash idempotency, throttling, sharing option. Recorded fixtures only.
- Data and artifact paths: `internal/cloud/sharepoint/`, `test/testdata/cloud/sharepoint/`.
- Execution path: `httptest.Server` replaying sanitized exchanges; quickXorHash test vectors.
- Acceptance gates: Fixture scenarios pass; quickXorHash matches published vectors; no network in
  tests.
- Documentation target: `docs/impl/current/cloud-publishing.md`
- Review checkpoint: `review-stage-3-cloud`.

#### prove-cloud-targets-on-test-accounts

Publish a generated video archive to real test accounts for both providers.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Acceptance](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md#acceptance)
- Agent status: RUN NEEDED
- Dependencies: `implement-google-drive-target`; `implement-sharepoint-target`;
  `provide-google-drive-test-account`; `provide-sharepoint-test-tenant`.
- User-visible outcome: Publishing is proven against the real services, including an interrupted
  upload resumed to completion.
- Scope boundary: Declared live run with operator-provided credentials from environment variables
  or the [environment file](../openspec/stage-1-core/cli.md#environment-file) `bin/.env`, whose
  credential keys are added to `.env.example` by the target tasks; evidence (logs with secrets
  redacted, remote listing) kept outside the repository.
- Data and artifact paths: `test/integration/cloud_test.go` (build tag `cloudlive`), run evidence
  under the operator's chosen directory.
- Execution path: `go test -tags cloudlive ./test/integration/...` on Linux with credentials
  present.
- Acceptance gates: Uploaded sizes and hashes match; interrupted upload resumes; re-publish uploads
  nothing; links open for the test account.
- Documentation target: `docs/impl/current/cloud-publishing.md`
- Review checkpoint: `review-stage-3-cloud`.

#### review-stage-3-cloud

Review cloud publishing security, resume and link invariants.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Development integrity](../openspec/spec.md#development-integrity)
- Agent status: CLEAR
- Task kind: checkpoint
- Dependencies: `prove-cloud-targets-on-test-accounts`.
- User-visible outcome: Stage 3 is coherent, secrets are contained and the binary remains static.
- Scope boundary: Publish WAL/recovery, secret redaction, token cache permissions, binary size and
  `CGO_ENABLED=0` build, link rewrite consistency. No speculative refactor.
- Data and artifact paths: Stage-3 records, `internal/cloud/`.
- Execution path: Invariant-to-evidence table, targeted tests, routed notes.
- Acceptance gates: Notes dispositioned; verdicts recorded; blockers repaired first; `make ci`
  passes.
- Documentation target: `docs/impl/current.md`
- Review checkpoint: none; this is the bounded checkpoint.

## Human-Assisted Tasks

### Video restore -- `video-restore`

#### approve-stage-1-on-operator-archive-copy

Decide whether stage 1 is fit for use on real archives after a trial on a copy of operator data.

- Serves: `video-restore` -- [Success criteria](../openspec/spec.md#success-criteria)
- Human status: HUMAN-GATED
- Dependencies: [Stage-1 proof](records/0025-restore-prove-stage-1-on-generated-archive.md).
- Requested input or decision: Run scan, split, interrupt, resume and restore on a disposable copy
  of a representative archive; review registry, descriptions, logs and timings; accept, or file defects.
  Where available, put one root on a CIFS/NFS share and start a second `arxgo` from another host
  against its lock; note scan throughput at the default `--checkpoint-every`; decide whether
  restore should skip video-archive files whose registry row is `conflict` or `skipped`. These are
  the routed notes `AUD-implement-filesystem-primitives-2`, `AUD-implement-run-lock-and-checkpoint-3`,
  `AUD-implement-scan-operation-and-csv-registry-3` and `AUD-review-stage-1-integrity-2` of
  [the stage-1 integrity review](records/0021-restore-review-stage-1-integrity.md#audit-handoff).
- Unblocks: Production use of stage 1. Stage-2 development does not wait for this decision.

### Cloud publishing -- `cloud-publishing`

#### provide-google-drive-test-account

Provide a Google Drive test location and credentials for the live proof.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Google Drive](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md#google-drive)
- Human status: BLOCKED BY HUMAN
- Dependencies: none.
- Requested input or decision: A test Google account or Shared Drive, a service account or OAuth
  client, and the environment variable names under which the credentials will be supplied
  (placed in the operator's `bin/.env` or process environment, never in the repository).
- Unblocks: `prove-cloud-targets-on-test-accounts`.

#### provide-sharepoint-test-tenant

Provide a SharePoint site, document library and Entra ID app registration for the live proof.

- Serves: `cloud-publishing` -- [Microsoft SharePoint](../openspec/stage-3-cloud/cloud-targets.md#microsoft-sharepoint)
- Human status: BLOCKED BY HUMAN
- Dependencies: none.
- Requested input or decision: Tenant id, site and drive ids, app registration with
  `Sites.Selected` or `Files.ReadWrite.All` consent, and the credential delivery method (for
  example the operator's `bin/.env`).
- Unblocks: `prove-cloud-targets-on-test-accounts`.
